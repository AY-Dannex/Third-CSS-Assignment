                I will dearly miss Steve Jobs he inspired me to keep gettimng the Iphones i have loved them ever since the first one. Steve Job was a great man and the awesome CEO for APPLE. He has inspired me to one day and go for and work work with the apple when i get old but my dream is to own Apple and follow by Steve Jobs way and make apple greater than before it was. But i will dearly miss Steve Jobs he's a great man and i will never forget him.

                What impact has Steve Jobs had om my life? Every short I've written as an adult  (and certainly everyone thst has been published), almost every email I;ve ever written, has been written on machines created by apple. I interracted online using an apple machine long before i ever encounted a PC. Steve Job helps to realise the star trek future i dreamed as a kid. And through his vision, I have been able to realise my one. You'll be missed, Mr Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work.

                Dear Steve's family, dear Apple Company I can't find words how to describe myh feelings... For me Apple means a lot - I got a good job using Apple products. I have found a new lifestyle thanks to Apple. And, of course, i've been always admiring your products. And for me everything in Apple is connected with Steve. I do hope he'll be remembered around the world as a genius.

                My thought and my prayers are with you all tonight. The company Steve started has touched the lives of many in this world and he will be missed. I know he will live on in spirit, throught the lives of all who know him as well. As a sign of respect of Steve, I will be turning my IPhone, Ipod and IPad off for one hour. May Steve's rest in peace.
